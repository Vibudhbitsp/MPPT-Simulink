# MPPT-Simulink
This MPPT system includes a high-efficiency DC-DC boost converter with a modified incremental
conductance algorithm that adjusts the duty cycle of the converter to draw maximum power from the PV
panel.In MPPT, the integral regulator is used to adjust the duty cycle of the DC-DC converter in the system,
which in turn adjusts the voltage level of the solar panel. The integral regulator helps to reduce the
steady-state error in the system and improve the accuracy of the tracking algorithm.
